b)	Create a new swift project and create the following class:
Name of the class is GradeBook, having the stored properties - student id, name, marks for three courses - course1, course2 and course3.
Define the initializer to initialize all the stored properties. Add the validations so that there won't be negative values for courses and they should be less or equal to 100.
Add a method in the class - calculateAverageGrade()->Double which calculates and returns the average grades for a student
Also add a method which returns the sting representation of all the property values.
In the main.swift file create at least two objects of the class and test it.
